# 📚 The Year of Turing – A Structured Reading Plan

## 🏆 Goal
Dedicate a year to studying Alan Turing’s life, work, and legacy by reading three major books:
- **Jack Copeland – *The Essential Turing***
- **Charles Petzold – *The Annotated Turing***
- **Andrew Hodges – *Alan Turing: The Enigma***

## 📅 Year-Long Checklist

### **🟢 Phase 1: The Foundations (Months 1–3)**
📌 **Goal:** Understand Turing’s early ideas, his influences, and what led to his 1936 paper.

- [ ] **Hodges – Chapters 1–8** (Turing’s early life + inspirations)
- [ ] **Copeland – Chapters 1–4** (Overview of Turing’s main contributions)
- [ ] **Petzold – Chapters 1–4** (Binary, algorithms, mechanical computation)
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Do I understand **why Turing developed the Turing Machine concept?**

---

### **🔵 Phase 2: Turing Machines & Computability (Months 4–5)**
📌 **Goal:** Deeply understand Turing’s 1936 paper and build a Turing Machine Simulator.

- [ ] **Petzold – Chapters 5–21** (Step-by-step breakdown of Turing’s 1936 paper)
- [ ] **Copeland – Chapters 5–9** (Computability, Entscheidungsproblem, Universal TM)
- [ ] **Start implementing Turing Machine Simulator (basic deterministic version)**
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Can I explain how a Universal Turing Machine works?

---

### **🟡 Phase 3: Cryptography & WWII (Months 6–7)**
📌 **Goal:** Learn about Turing’s role in cryptography and how his wartime work shaped computing.

- [ ] **Hodges – Chapters 9–14** (Turing’s time at Bletchley Park, Enigma codebreaking)
- [ ] **Copeland – Chapters 10–14** (Mathematical details of Turing’s cryptography work)
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** What was Turing’s greatest contribution to WWII cryptanalysis?

---

### **🔴 Phase 4: AI & The Philosophy of Computing (Months 8–10)**
📌 **Goal:** Explore Turing’s later work on AI, the Turing Test, and machine intelligence.

- [ ] **Hodges – Chapters 15–18** (Turing’s AI research, his later years)
- [ ] **Copeland – Chapters 15–17** (Turing’s AI papers, philosophy of computing)
- [ ] **Copeland – Chapter 18: *Computing Machinery and Intelligence* (The Turing Test)**
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Could a machine ever think? How did Turing define "intelligence"?

---

### **🟣 Phase 5: Turing’s Legacy & Revisiting GEB (Months 11–12)**
📌 **Goal:** Reflect on Turing’s legacy and revisit *Gödel, Escher, Bach* with new insights.

- [ ] **Copeland – Chapters 18–20** (Turing’s impact on modern computing)
- [ ] **Hodges – Final reflections on Turing’s life and impact**
- [ ] **Final Checkpoint:** How has my understanding of Turing evolved over the year?
